    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      My mom always makes her pumpkin roll around Thanksgiving and takes one to <br>
      work where everyone asks her if she can make them one and they all want
      the recipe. <br>
      You may want to halve the recipe unless you are making for a
      crowd or to give away. <br>
      It makes a lot. It is without a doubt the best
      pumpkin roll I've ever had!
